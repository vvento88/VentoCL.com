            <h3 class="headline headline--centered headline--medium">Who I Am&hellip;</h3>
              <p>Your local Web and Tech enthusiast.</p>
              <p>
                My job is to help you grow and become more efficient through technology.
                I have a knack for solving problems and always making sure to fully explain
                in a way that anyone can understand.  Father, Husband, and a Power Lifter,
                I can relate to how life always pulls our attention to different aspects of
                our lives and we have to pick and choose how we spend our time and energy.
                Results don&rsquo;t happen overnight, none that are lasting that is, so working together
                to build up your dream and ideas for the world to see is what I specialize in.
                Let me worry about the technical stuff while you focus on what truly matters&hellip;
                <strong>Growing Your Business!</strong>

            <h3 class="headline headline--centered headline--medium">Why I do it&hellip;</h3>
            <p>
              Too often are we slowed down by the overwhelming pull of miniscule tasks.
              Technology is meant to help us automate these small tasks and let us focus
              on the larger, more pressing matters.  What happens when something breaks down
              or there is an error somewhere in the initial setup?  We spend hours trying to
              figure out how to fix it and may even end up manually running these small tasks
              so that we don&rsquo;t have to deal with the headache of solving that issue.  This is
              where I come in and help you fix that website, setup your tech for your business
              and make sure you are running as efficient as possible.  Let me worry about the
              little technicalities to help you <strong>Run Your Business Efficiently.</strong>
